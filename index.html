            <h1>Needy Girl Overload</h1>
            <p>
                It is a "multi-ending ADV" developed by xemono and WSS playground. The premise of the game revolves around the life of a girl named “OMGkawaiiAngel-chan”, a young girl with a rather extreme need for approval attempting to become the #1 “Internet Angel” (streamer) with the help of P-Chan (the player).

                    KAngel posts on Tweeter declaring that she will ascend from the internet and become a real angel. Her followers start to freak out, but they soon enough follow KAngel and quit the internet with her, which leaves Tweeter as a desolate wasteland with few users left. After some unknown time, KAngel announces her return. saying, "Ask and you shall receive! The internet angel is back, cuter than ever!" After realizing that there is nobody left, she deletes the post, and the top of the feed says, "You've reached an unknown ending." A "the end" tab pops up, saying "A powerful illusion, like that of an angel's smile."

                    At the start of Day 25, Ame texts P-Chan that she has been feeling sluggish and crabby recently because she has been working so hard and she decides to do her daily vanity search, which is filled with hate. She then rants on her private tweeter account that she has been getting more hate than usual, and makes a post on her KAngel account that something got her a little shaken up, but she's going to keep going. Immediately, the post floods with annoying replies to which Ame texts P-Chan how much the normal comments start to bother her and how she's been going through it lately.

                    Ame texts you in the noon about her 1 million follower milestone, but she says that she is tired and scared and feels like everyone hates her, then saying that she needs to wreck the world before it wrecks her, and thats shes no angel. At night when you stream Internet Angel 5, she transforms into an Ame-color-schemed KAngel outfit instead of her usual KAngel outfit, and adopts a personality opposite of KAngel's regular one. She rants about how fucked up the internet is and blames everything on her fans. After the stream, she tweets about how she is not going let them get away with this.
